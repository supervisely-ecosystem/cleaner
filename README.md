## Overview

This application allows admins to clear the teams folders for all teams in an instance over a period of time(in days).
Cleaning in teams folders will be carried out in the following paths:

- `/tmp/supervisely/export` - directory where temporary files are saved during export.
- `/offline-sessions` - directory where files that make apps sessions available after shutdown are saved.
- directories where temporary files could also be saved:
  - `/Export-as-masks`
  - `/Export-to-Supervisely`
  - `/yolov5_format`
  - `/Export to COCO`
  - `/ApplicationsData/Export-to-Pascal-VOC`
  - `/activity_data`
  - `/reference_items`
  - `/Export only labeled items`
  - `/ApplicationsData/Export-Metadata`
  - `/cityscapes_format`
  - `/video_from_images`
  - `/tags_to_urls`
  - `/export-to-dota`

Most of all these paths are used for exporting data and many users forget to empty these folders after they finish their work.
This is necessary to delete obsolete temporary data that is no longer used and takes up a lot of space on the instance.

After the cleaning is finished, the application will continue to run in the background and resume cleaning after a specified period of time (in days). You can stop it in `Workspace Tasks`.

2. Adjust settings 
  - **Select team** whose files you want to clear (or choose `all teams`)
  - **Set period in days** - files older than this period will be deleted
  - **Enter count of days to sleep** after cleaning before the next start
  - **Set batch size** to determine how much files will be deleted with the one request. If you get an error, try reducing the batch size.
  -  Press the `RUN` button.
